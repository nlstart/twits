# Notes

As of 0.3.1 Twits is now a plugin and is no longer a menu item. Because of this you will need to go to your menus page, which will remove the old menu item, and then go to the Plugin Manager to install Twits. Once you have installed Twits you can configure it and then head back to the menus page and re-add it to your menu area.

Secondly, the template file has changed. See below for the new shortcodes.

# Twits

Twits is a menu item that will display your current Twitter status.
