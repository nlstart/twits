# Notes

As of 0.3.1 Twits is now a plugin and is no longer a menu item. Because of this you will need to go to your menus page, which will remove the old menu item, and then go to the Plugin Manager to install Twits. Once you have installed Twits you can configure it and then head back to the menus page and re-add it to your menu area.

Secondly, the template file has changed. See below for the new tags.

# Twits

Twits is a menu item that will display your current Twitter status.

## Configuration

# Templates

The information displayed in the Twits menu can be customized by editing the `twits_template.php` file inside the `e107_plugins/twits_menu/` folder.
Alternatively, you can save the `twits_template.php` file inside your theme folder and it will be changed on a per theme basis.

## Tags

The following tags are converted inside the template file:

* `%_USERNAME_%` → Displays your Twitter username, which links to your Twitter profile.
* `%_STATUS_%` → Displays your current status. #tags and @mentions are automatically converted.
* `%_DATESTAMP_%` → The datestamp of your status update. Converted using e107's convert_date() function.
